        <p>
          Healthy food choices do not have to be complicated. Individual food
          choices are less important than the overall pattern of eating. For
          instance, eating a piece of cake once in a while is different than the
          pattern of eating a piece of cake every day. An eating pattern should
          focus on nutrient-dense foods that are full of vitamins and minerals.
          Eating foods from all of the food groups is a good idea for balance.
          Include items from two food groups at every snack, and from three to
          five food groups at every meal.

          Small daily lifestyle changes can lead to better health. To get
          started, keep a food diary for a week, then evaluate it to see if a
          variety of foods from the food groups are included. For some people
          the simple act of writing what they eat and drink improves the quality
          of their choices.

            <h4>Sunshine egg salad</h4>
            <p>
              Put a large pan of salted water on to simmer for your eggs. Toast
              most of the dukkah in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium
              heat for 2 minutes, then tip in the grains. Drain, finely chop and
              add the peppers. Cook and stir for 5 minutes, season to
              perfection, then divide between your plates. Return the pan to the
              heat and quickly wilt the spinach. Season to perfection and divide
              over the grains.

            <h4>Tahini BBQ lamb chops</h4>
            <p>
              If you can, buy nicely trimmed lamb racks without too much of a
              fat cap, so that you donâ€™t need to worry about rendering fat off
              them before dividing into individual chops. Be forewarned, though:
              there will be a fair amount of smoke while cooking these, so they
              are best grilled outside. We use tahini in a few different
              versions of BBQ sauce, as the sesame paste lends itself so well to
              roasted meats, adding a rich nutty note. Here we include anchovies
              for a savoury touch and pomegranate molasses for sweetness.
