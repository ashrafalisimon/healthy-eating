        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Healthy food choices do not have to be complicated. Individual food
          choices are less important than the overall pattern of eating. For
          instance, eating a piece of cake once in a while is different than the
          pattern of eating a piece of cake every day. An eating pattern should
          focus on nutrient-dense foods that are full of vitamins and minerals.
          Eating foods from all of the food groups is a good idea for balance.
          Include items from two food groups at every snack, and from three to
          five food groups at every meal.
